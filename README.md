# CodeWeekend-Session-4---Assignment-
The assignment for this week is:
- create a multiplication table for numbers from 2 to 10
- create a  calculator that does at least the four basic mathematic operations
- create a function that takes two parameters as width and length for a rectangle and prints that rectangle using (*).

Note: A good practice would be to use multiple files, put your functions in a separate file and call them from another file.

Where to submit the assignments?
Push your codes to GitHub, make sure your repository is public, and share the link here, under this post or send the link to Mr Asadullah Hashimi Asadullah.
